MPCNC Pen Holder

This is an adapter for holding a Fisher Space Plotter Pen (from
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07645YD1M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
in place of the cutting tool on the MPCNC Lowrider 2.  This fits -my- hole cutout
(I did not end up using the dust cover from the original design, as I couldn't find the
dewalt for sale so I ended up buying a different router with it's own dust collection cover.

This fits into the hole I made for the router using friction, and sits on top of the router plate
on the CNC machine.  It allows the pen to move up and down but not side to side with three
vertical 150mm steel rods and linear bearings

- 150mm rods - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCOMFLT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- linear bearings - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KR6H3XK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

These are the parts in this model

- Base - holds the rods vertical, sits on top of the Lowrider's router plate
- Insert - cylinder to push through the base and the router plate's hole to hold everything together
- Slider - This holds three sets of linear bearings to allow the pen to move up and down.  It also 
           provides space for up to 40 US nickel (5c) coins at 5g each to provide 250g of downward force.
- Caddy - The clip that grabs the pen top (remove the tape label)

Currently at v1.0 the caddy is meant to glue to the bottom of the slider.   A future version may
provide a way to slide this down through the weight tube and glue it there (still needs to be
glued so that the entire slider moves when pressed on the pen tip.

Python:

These models are presented as python that runs within FreeCAD's CLI.   Open FreeCAD, paste the
init.py first, then tube.py.

Then paste each additional file into a new document.  This will give you the models in FreeCad
to tweak or export to stl for your slicer.
